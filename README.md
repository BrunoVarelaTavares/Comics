For this project I use for the app navigation the Single Activity architecture with Navigation component, Kodein for the dependency injection and for the app architecture I implemented Clean Architecture. 
For the app structure the app folder contains the app base structure and helper classes and the main folder contains the layers of the clean architecture Presentation, Domain and Data, Layer.
